The relay module as a medium to connect the microcontroller to the LED bulb.

## Arduino UNO

Arduino UNO is used just to get it's 5V supply as the relay needs a 5V to be operated

## LED Bulb

The LED bulb makes the level of this project up to 1 level as we are using a high voltage supply and it is clearly NOT FOR KIDS!

## Google Assistant
